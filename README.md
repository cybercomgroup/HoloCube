# HoloCube
Solving  Rubik's Cube with Hololens

## Install project

  * Download unity  [Link](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive)
  * Download HoloToolKit for unity on Microsoft GitHub (The same version as your unity program) [Link](https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/releases)
  * Download OpenCV for Unity from unity asset store. Gabriel has credentials for the unity account. [Link](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/opencv-for-unity-21088)

Now everything should work and the unity project should be "playable" in editing mode.
